Voter selftest application
==========================

This application is used for internal VoltDB testing.
It is invoked by several scripts in the pro repo, under
tests/apptests/voter.

It mostly uses source code from test_apps/voter in the
internal repo.

The current differences:

- Rejected (too many) votes are counted and returned by the Vote procedure.
  This is useful for testing replication - since the hash of the replication
  result will be checked against the hash of the original result.  Differences
  will cause replication failure. 

- There is an HTTPBenchmark, possibly unused, that has not been integrated
  into test_apps/voter yet.

- The compiled code lives in a single voter.jar, unlike the usual case with
  separate voter-client.jar and voter-proc.jar files. This is assumed to be
  necessary for existing test scripts,
  
Building the voter.jar file uses source from test_apps/voter
and then overlays the local HTTPBenchmark and Vote classes.
